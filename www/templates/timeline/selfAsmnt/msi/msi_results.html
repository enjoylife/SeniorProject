		<h3>Motivated Skills Inventory Results</h3>

		<p>The ratings are a combination of motivation plus skill level. <b><u>These results are important!</u></b> They can be referenced anytime from your Career Binder.</p>

		<p>A skill rating of 8 means you are highly skilled and highly motivated. A score of 7 means you are slightly lacking in motivation or skill, etc.</p>

		<p>Skills you rate below a 6 will not be considered.</p>
		
		<h4><b>Focus on your 8s!</b></h4>
