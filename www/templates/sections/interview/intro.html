<p>Interviewing effectively is an acquired skill. Very few people are so talented that they can do it well the first time without much preparation.
If you really want to be successful in interview- ing, I recommend that you start by understand- ing that there are things you must do before you interview, there are things to expect during an interview, as well as things you must do to follow up after an interview.</p>
