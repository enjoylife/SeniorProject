<p style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">What I say is that if you don't know where you want to go,  you're not going to get there. The point is that you have to set goals.  </p> 

<p>When it comes to your career,  it is certain that you will be focused on what comes next and what your next move will be.  But what is the point of that if it is not connected to some larger context,  purpose and direction in life?  Perhaps all you want now is to find a survival job,  something that will keep you moving along or moving towards the next step.  Perhaps you just want something that will get you started on the right path.  Even if that is all you want,  you need to have some idea about where the path might lead or where you want it to take you.  That is what the Chesire Cat was trying to tell Alice.</p>

<p>Sometimes when people dare to dream about the future and future possibilities,  they become paralyzed.  It seems so far and so hard and so impossible.  Sometimes people are immobilized because nothing seems to be happening now and it is hard to imagine that there might be some life beyond the immediate horizon.  Your task now is to dare to imagine.  Even if you can't get there from here and even if you can't do it today,  you need to have the dream in mind.    </p>

<p>A career counseling issue that often comes up with adolescents is that they set their sights on "impossible" goals.  A young kid will say that he plans to become an NFL quarterback and that he has no other interests or goals.  Those advising him could set him straight.  They could tell him that it is an almost impossible goal.  My view is that if that's the goal,  it should be encouraged.  What would I tell that young man?  I would say that he needs to stay out of trouble and to work hard and study hard.  If you want to be an NFL quarterback,  you have to finish high school and get into college and maintain eligibility for the team.  You have to exercise regularly and stay away from drugs and alcohol.   I would tell him to do all of the things I would tell him to do if he told me that he wanted to be an accountant.  I would tell him to have dreams and to set goals and to see where the path might lead.</p>
