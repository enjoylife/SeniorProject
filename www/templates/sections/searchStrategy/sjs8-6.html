<p><b>Immediately after the interview, document the contact and place the information in your career binder.</b></p>


<p>Store the person's business card in a safe place, and make sure you have written down the names of everyone they referred you to. </p>

<p><b>Next, "debrief" yourself.</b> Make sure you have answered the following questions:</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>What did I learn?</li>
		<li>How does what I learned fit with my skills, values and interests?</li>
		<li>What else do I need to know? Who else do I need to talk with?</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Then, before the day is out,  <b>send a Thank you note.</b>   It only needs to be a few lines long. Express your appreciation and tell them what you plan to do next. </p>

<p>Finally, review the notes you've taken:  Are there any other action steps to be taken on the basis of the information you obtained? </p>

<p>At the end of each interview, it is time to make certain that you have your next informational interview set up. A really good interview is one that has provided you with names of more people to speak with. </p>

<p>The really best interview is one where you learn that you have found an approachable organization, one that has job opportunities that you can start considering and following up on.</p> 

<p>The more of these interviews you do, the more likely it is that you will find a company you want to work for and it will be time to start tailoring your presentation (i.e., your resume) to secure that position.</p>
