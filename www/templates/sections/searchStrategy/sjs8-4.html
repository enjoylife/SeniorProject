<p><b>How to arrange an Informational Interview</b></p>

<p>
	1.Telephone the person you are interested in talking with and request a meeting. <br>
	2. Explain that you are exploring your career options. <br>
	3. Tell them who referred you to them and explain that you really are just seeking advice.
</p>

<p><b>You absolutely must follow up this phone call with an email</b> confirming your appointment and indicating how much you are looking forward to meeting with them.</p>

<p><b>Always tell the person that you are seeking to meet with that you need only 20 minutes of his or her time</b> to meet at his or her convenience.  Most people - even the busiest - have 20 minutes to share with a person exploring a career field.  (Your appointment may last longer,  so don't book yourself too tightly.)</p>

<p><b>Remember these important rules:</b></p>

<p>If you call or write, <b>be absolutely clear in how you present your request.</b>  You must avoid allowing the person you wish to see, the receptionist or the secretary to assume that you are seeking a job interview. Some individuals have had luck just dropping in and requesting to meet with an individual in a particular department. This is a little dicier than making an appointment.</p>

<p><b>Don't be late.  Get there on time.</b>  The person you are seeing is doing you a favor.  Be businesslike and dress professionally.  You don't want to dress like you are there for a job interview,  but <b>you want to look nice.</b>  Slobs don't get jobs!</p>

<p><b>Don't bring a resume!!!</b>   You can send one after your informational interview,  tailored to the needs of the company,   if it seems appropriate.</p>

<p><b>Prepare your questions beforehand</b> and write them down to take with you.  Ask yourself what you need to know about the occupation, firm or industry.   <b>Do your homework!!!</b></p>
